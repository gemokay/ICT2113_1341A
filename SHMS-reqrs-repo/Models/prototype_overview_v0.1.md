# 8. Prototype Overview

## 8.1 Purpose of the Prototype

A low-fidelity prototype was developed during the Analysing phase to
support requirements clarification, validation of operational
assumptions, and early risk reduction. The prototype is not intended to
represent a final system design or user interface. Instead, it serves as
an exploratory artefact to aid stakeholder understanding. It also
enables us to test the feasibility and coherence of key requirements
derived from the Project Specification. Its primary role is to
facilitate discussion, uncover ambiguities, and support informed
interpretation of requirements.

## 8.2 Scope of the Prototype

The prototype focuses on a limited subset of high-risk and high-impact
system capabilities identified during the Breakdown activity. These
include:

-   Student attendance check-in through QR scanning\
-   Basic room and occupancy visibility for administrative users\
-   Role-based access views for key user roles such as Students and
    Hostel Operations Managers\
-   Audit visibility for selected administrative actions

Features that fall outside the immediate scope of requirements
clarification --- including financial transactions, comprehensive
reporting, and external system integrations --- were intentionally
excluded to avoid premature design commitment and scope expansion during
the Analysing phase.

## 8.3 Prototype Fidelity & Constraints

The prototype was implemented at a high fidelity level. Its emphasis was
placed on functional flow, information structure, and interaction
sequencing rather than visual design or user interface polish. Interface
elements, labels, and navigation structures are indicative and subject
to change in later phases.

The prototype operates under several constraints:

-   Absence of a persistent backend or production data\
-   Simplified validation and error-handling logic\
-   Assumed infrastructure and device capabilities consistent with
    clarified requirements

As such, the prototype should be interpreted as a conceptual validation
tool rather than an implementation blueprint.

## 8.4 Role of the Prototype

Within the BCIC framework, the prototype primarily supports the
**Clarify** and **Interpret** activities. It:

-   Reduces ambiguity in stakeholder understanding by making abstract
    requirements more concrete\
-   Enables testing of the practicality and coherence of interpreted
    requirements\
-   Assists in revealing hidden assumptions or workflow gaps that may
    not be evident from textual specifications

Feedback and insights derived from prototype usage were documented and
incorporated into the requirements repository as part of the
regulated-revision process.

## 8.5 Limitations and Forward Use

The prototype does not constitute a commitment to specific technologies,
system architectures, or user interface designs. Its outputs are
advisory and analytical in nature and are intended solely to support
requirements analysis.

The prototype may be refined, replaced, or discarded entirely as the
project progresses into the Specifying and subsequent Design phases,
depending on evolving requirements and design decisions.
